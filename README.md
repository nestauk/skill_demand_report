# Content
There are three things in here. A copy of the report - this is the draft, it has been submitted. It'll be updated. Then supplementary tables and samples from the code used in the report. No data can be published.

## Tables
These estimates accompany Nesta's report on skill demand: Developing experimental estimates of regional skill demand.

This excel file contains the annual stock of vacancies by Travel To Work Area (TTWA) normalised by 100 economically active residents (Annual Population Survey). We show these estimates for all years between 2015 and 2019. Only TTWAs with at least 40,000 economically active residents aged 16 and over are included.

The dataset of online job adverts on which these estimates are based was provided by Textkernel.

## Sample code
